# Dynamics---RotorBearingSystems
Study of the occurrence of instability in rotating machines

# Repository topic
This repository contains a synthetic version of the work done for the second part (Project 2) of the course in Dynamics of Machinery (41514) at DTU. The work involves studying the instability of a rotating shaft of a large compressor, which is supported by different types of bearings. The dynamic effects of these bearings are examined. The result of the study, conducted by creating a series of digital twins of the shaft in MATLAB, is the report available in this repository. Since the project was adapted to fit within the time constraints of a 5 ECTS course, some of the MATLAB files were provided by Professor Ilmar Santos (DTU) and are therefore not entirely written by me, as specified in the interested files.
